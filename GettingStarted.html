                    <p class="card-text" id="AboutUs">
                        To play Status Deck, simply have each player draw a card from the Status Deck before determining the first player. The effects of the Status Card go into effect immediately from this moment and can theoretically affect any element of the game. Make the Status Cards (Raw Text) pages following this page available for all players to browse before games begin; it is off limits during games.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:center;"><h5> Status Card</h5> A player’s active card drawn from the Status Deck. A player must abide by all instructions on the Status Card at all times. <br>
                            If a player inadvertently takes a game action that is illegal as per their Status Card, it is treated as any other invalid game action. What exactly this means depends on the group playing Status Deck and making clear what this entails ahead of time is highly recommended. We recommend rewinding when able.
                            If a game effect would compel a player to take an action forbidden by their Status Card, they reveal their Status Card and do not take that action.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Status Die</h5> At the beginning of each of their turns, a player always rolls 1d6 -- their Status Die. Only some Status Cards actually care about the result of the Status Die, but the Die is always rolled to help obscure the nature of each player’s Status Card. The Die remains until your next turn and should be displayed clearly for both players. <br>
                            We encourage you to make a habit of checking your Status Card every time you roll the Die, even if you have no effects related to the Die.
                            </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Game Action</h5> When a Status Card refers to a game action, it means any and all actions taken by a player within the game. This does not include any outside of game actions, including conceding, obeying social norms, or other such nonsense.    </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Status Deck:</h5> The core deck from which all Status Cards are drawn.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:center;"><h3> Statuses Explained </h3>

                    Status Deck format was created by Dylan Coffey who was inspired by Drawback Chess by Glyder Games. In this format, players draw from a deck of various drawbacks, restrictions, and other modifications before beginning the game. <br><br> 
                    
                    They must abide by any and all instructions on the Status Card, but must not reveal the Card to their opponent at any time unless explicitly instructed to do so by a Status Card. Both playing around and attempting to identify these Status Cards is part of the fun of this variant, which we have attempted to balance such that no particular deck archetype is completely crippled by a given Status Card. <br><br> 
                    
                    It is expected that some decks will be affected more or less severely by a given Status Card; we suggest coming to terms with this before play!</p>

                    <p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Berserk</h5>You must attack at least once per turn if able. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Blind</h5>Your second card drawn during the Draw Phase each turn cannot be discarded for CP, cast, or played until your Main Phase 2. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Bind</h5>You may search no more than once per turn. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Charm</h5>You must pass priority when the stack is empty during either player’s Attack Phase. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Chicken</h5>Your Forwards cannot block Forwards with Power equal to or greater than their own. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Confused</h5>Your first game action must be the following according to your Status Die roll. If you cannot take that type of Action, you may act normally beginning in your Main Phase 2.
1-2 = cast a Forward or Monster
3-4 = cast a Backup or Summon
5 = use an Action or Special Ability
6 = you may choose freely
 </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Curse</h5>You may cast only 1 card from your Limit Break deck during this game. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Disease</h5>The first time upon suffering damage that you could activate an EX Burst effect which adds one or more cards to your hand, you must decline this EX Burst. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Disable</h5>You cannot cast or play cards with a Cost equal to the value of your Status Die. </p><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Killsight</h5>If you are dealt damage by a Forward with Cost equal to the value of your Status Die, reveal this Status Card and you lose the game. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Level 5/10 Death</h5>At the end of your turn, if the sum of yours and your opponent’s cards in hand are exactly 5 or 10, or if the sum of the Cost of your characters in play is a multiple of 5, reveal this Status Card and you lose the game. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Muddle</h5>When choosing targets for Summons and abilities, you cannot target Characters with a Cost equal to your Status Die. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Oil</h5>If you suffer 3 or more points of damage in 1 turn, reveal this Status Card and you lose the game. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Paralysis</h5>You may not reorder the cards in your hand; you must place them in your hand in the rightmost position when drawn. (You can still manipulate and move cards, but their ‘mechanical order’ cannot change.) You cannot cast, discard for CP, or play the card in the position matching your Status Die, counting from the left. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Petrify</h5>You may not overpay to cast cards. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Poison</h5>Upon taking your sixth point of damage, reveal this Status Card and you lose the game. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Provoke</h5>You must block at least once per turn if able. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Silence</h5>You may not cast Summons during your opponent’s turn. (Resolve EX Burst effects normally.)
 </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Sleep</h5>Your characters are unable to attack or use Rest Icon Abilities until the Main Phase 2 of your next turn after they are played, rather than at the beginning of your next turn. </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Slow</h5>You may cast only 1 of a given card type each turn (Forward, Backup, Monster, Summon).
 </p><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h5>Terror</h5>If you have suffered a point of damage on a given turn, you must block if able. </p><br>
