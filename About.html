                        Status Deck format was created by Dylan Coffey who was inspired by Drawback Chess by Glyder Games. In this format, players draw from a deck of various drawbacks, restrictions, and other modifications before beginning the game. <br><br> 
                        
                        They must abide by any and all instructions on the Status Card, but must not reveal the Card to their opponent at any time unless explicitly instructed to do so by a Status Card. Both playing around and attempting to identify these Status Cards is part of the fun of this variant, which we have attempted to balance such that no particular deck archetype is completely crippled by a given Status Card. <br><br> 
                        
                        It is expected that some decks will be affected more or less severely by a given Status Card; we suggest coming to terms with this before play!</p>
